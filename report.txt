## Feature Extraction (Max 200 Words)

PCA approach with custom feature selection is used for dimensionality reduction. Procedure 
starts with computing 40 eigenvectors for 40 highest eigenvalues derived using data's 
covariance matrix. Then, mean normalization is applied and vectors are initially reduced to 
40 dimensions. The next stage performs the feature selection by finding 20 best eigenvectors 
out of 40 computed. It compares all pairs of labels of the dataset; if a pair's classes meet 
MIN_DATA_FREQ criteria, then divergence is computed between the two. Furthermore, divergence
of a pair is used to select indices of 3 best eigenvectors of one pair and values of referring 
indices of top scoring eigenvectors are increased in dictionary by data frequency of a pair. 
After iterating each pair, the dictionary is sorted in descending order by its values (scores) 
and top 20 keys are selected. They correspond to selected eigenvectors' indices. Finally, 
data is reduced according to 20 eigenvectors and saved in model. I decided to use PCA, as it 
works well for dataset of such size and with such correlation between samples. I select 20 
best eigenvectors out of 40, as testing proved that some further eigenvectors (e.g. 31st) 
are more useful features than some from the top 20.

## Letter Classifier (Max 200 Words)

The letter classification is performed on reduced feature vectors using the weighted KNN 
(K-Nearest-Neighbour) approach with the K value adjusted as 9. The K-value has been confirmed as 
the best choice after testing all K's in range 1-30. In essence, the process starts by computing 
the correlation distance between test and train feature vectors. After testing different distance 
measures (including cosine, euclidean, square euclidean), I decided to select scipy-provided 
"correlation", as it works effectively considering the mentioned K, reduced vectors, selected weight 
approach, and so scores very well for both low an high quality images. The second step of the 
classification is finding K (i.e. 9) nearest distances and matching them with their labels. 
Furthermore, weight measure is applied to each of the K-nearest distance's class labels. It is 
worth mentioning that the introduced weights are found by calculating the inverse square of distance 
for each of the occurence of a class in the K-nearest distances, i.e. w = 1 / (d * d). Finally, 
the class with the highest sum of weights is selected as the best choice for a classification 
of a particular sample. 

## Word Finder (Max 200 Words)

After letter classification, finding words is performed in two main steps: building word-
guesses from generated coordinates and finding closest match to the target accordingly. 
The word guess generation starts with computing all possible start and end positions of 
the target word in all directions at once (diagonal, column, row). The word length is 
considered so that each guess matches it. Furthermore, all possible word guesses are built 
according to expected positions using neighbouring letters from the label grid. Each guess 
is stored in a dictionary (key) with its positions (value). Then, the closest (or exact) 
match of the word is found by computing Hamming distance between each guess and the target. 
The guess scoring lowest distance is selected, matched with its positions in dictionary, which 
are returned. I decided to generate all possible valid positions of a word at once, as it is 
computationally efficient - no need for separate approaches for testing directions. Also, 
I can be sure that no option was skipped. I applied Hamming as distance metric, as it 
only compares how many letters in a guess are in the same position as in target. I tested 
Levenshtein distance, but it over-complicated the problem.

## Performance

My percentage correctness scores (to 1 decimal place) for the development data are as follows.

High quality data:

- Percentage Letters Correct: 99.7%
- Percentage Words Correct: 100.0%

Low quality data:

- Percentage Letters Correct: 58.7%
- Percentage Words Correct: 63.9%

## Other information (Optional, Max 100 words)

I tested several image preprocessing techniques when trying to enhance letter classification. 
I ended up not using them, still they are worth mentioning. Both could have been applied when 
loading the puzzle feature vectors in the first step. Firstly, I tested filters provided by 
the PIL's ImageFilter class. Interestingly, filters such as EDGE_ENHANCE, or SHARPEN, boosted
the letter classification results for low quality images (up to 63.0%). Concurrently, they 
decreased the high quality results (down to 95.0%). Binarization was the second attempted 
approach. Unfortunately, this technique did not fit the problem domain and decreased the 
results in both cases.
